Given a positive integer n, find the length of its Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence is generated sequentially where

n = n / 2 if n is even
n = 3 * n + 1 if n is odd
And the sequence ends if n = 1

Input
n = 11
Output
15
Explanation
The Collatz sequence is: [11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1] and its length is 15.

int solve(int n) {
int i=0;
while(n!=1)
{
if(n%2)
{
n=3*n+1;
}
else if(n%2==0)
{
n=n/2;
}
i++;
}
return i+1;
}
